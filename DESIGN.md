# Portfolio Website Design

## Purpose

This website is intended to demonstrate my abilities as a web developer as well as provide a detailed list of my professional & personal experiences, interests, etc.

## Design Goals

I intend for this site to consist of one dynamic page which shows varying amounts of information controlled by both a slider (amount) and filters (topics). My initial focus will be on this core functionality. Later, I will work to add more visually appealing elements and pictures.
